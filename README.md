# ab-test

# Project Overview
For this project, we  will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

# Software Needed
- Python: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, StatsModels
- Jupyter Notebook

# Wrangling:
- remove duplicates or records with missing 
- correct rows where the landing_page and group columns don't align

# Analysis:
- Compute probabilities of converting on both pages 
- Perform Hypothesis Testing
- Calculate P Values
- Conduct Logistic Regression

# Conclusions:
- Is there evidence to suggest that one page will lead to more conversions?
- Does the country of the user impact the rate of conversion between the two pages?
